WordLadderConsole

Solution can work with more than 4 letters :)

Designed whth tests.

Some reuseble code.

I just wanted to separate the word ladder library.
.Net 6.0

File interaction separated. Built to read/write async.
Value container(Model) separated.
Controller separated.
WordLadder Engine calculator separated.  I could have done with webService and Json, but this was made between work and family time.
Tests done.

After some investigation i crossed this site: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/solution/
And after that i stumbled on this, and when i saw the fastest and memory optimized solution:
C# BFS Solution, faster than 94% and less than 100% memory
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/discuss/375730/C-BFS-Solution-faster-than-94-and-less-than-100-memory

I have to had this solution! :)
